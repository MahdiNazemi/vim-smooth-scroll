*smooth_scroll.txt* Plugin that makes scrolling smooth

                                                *smooth_scroll-config*
This plugin requires no configuration.

                                                *'g:scroll_lines_per_draw'*
                                                *'g:scroll_frame_duration'*
If you'd like to tune how the scroll looks, you can modify the following
parameters:
>
    let g:scroll_lines_per_draw=1
    let g:scroll_frame_duration=10
<
                                                *'g:scroll_disable_mapping'*
The default mapping can be disabled by setting the following variable.
 >
    let g:scroll_disable_mapping = 1
<
                                                *'g:scroll_follow'*
When the screen is scrolled in vim without this plugin using CTRL-F, the
cursor only moves because the screen is scrolled far enough that the cursor
wouldn't be visible and |'scrolloff'| from the top or bottom of the screen.  If
you'd like the cursor to stay where it is relative to the screen, then set:
 >
    let g:scroll_follow = 1
<
